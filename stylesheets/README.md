# Main file

This main file follows the guidelines outlined [here](http://sass-guidelin.es/#main-file).
It is the only Sass file from the whole code base not to begin with an underscore, and does not contain anything but `@import` and comments. 
To maintain readability, the main file respects the following guidlines:
* one '@import' per folder
* a linebreak after @import
* each file on its own line
* a new line after the last import from a folder
* file extensions and leading underscores omitted

*Inspired by this [boilerplate,](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/sass-boilerplate/tree/master/stylesheets) this file is a simplified version of the Sass 7-1 pattern - in my case, 2 folders,1 file*
